C++ Compiler
==================

It is interesting to make your own compiler. It will compile your C++ source code form .txt or any other format input files 
and output the results to console. Plese check the test.txt file to learn more about the sample input. 

This project applies advanced object oriented concepts in C++, such as inheritance and polymorphism.

Hopefully, it will provide some meaningful stuff to you and always, happy coding!
